# Results

This folder contains all analytical results for the research project.
For independent results, and to isolate the scope of work done for a particular result, here is a suggested structure:

```shell
Results/
|_ yyyy-mm-dd_result1/
   |_ Snakefile         # Workflow control for generating all files in this folder
   |_ README.md         # Description of the purpose of this result, what was done, and the 
```

[`snakemake`](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake) is a good command line utility for data workflow control.
This manages input and output files, and contains code to reproduce all the results generated by it, integrates with high performance computing clusters, Anaconda environments, and can generate runtime reports.
`Snakefile` is the file that contains the code and flow control between processes (analogous to a `Makefile` for `make`).
