# Code

This folder contains all the code and scripts to produce the results and plots in the `/results/` folder.
Keeping the code separate from results still allows you to use the results from previous analyses, but keeps the separation between code and results a bit cleaner.

```shell
code/
└── yyyy-mm-dd_result1/
   ├── Snakefile         # Workflow control for generating all files in this folder
   └── README.md         # Description of the purpose of this result, what was done, and the 
```

This manages input and output files, and contains code to reproduce all the results generated by it, integrates with high performance computing clusters, Anaconda environments, and can generate runtime reports.
The `Snakefile` is the file that contains the code and flow control between processes (analogous to a `Makefile` for `make`).
