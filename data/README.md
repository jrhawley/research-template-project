# Data

This folder contains all the data used in this project.
That includes raw, user-generated datasets, preprocessed data that will be used for analysis, metadata, and external data from other sources.
Here is a suggested structure:

```shell
data/
├── external/           # raw data from external sources collected for this research project
├── processed/          # pre-processed and annotated data, generated from `raw/`
└── raw/                # raw data for the research
```

This structure helps with keeping [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf), reproducible workflows, and easy [data sharing](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing).
