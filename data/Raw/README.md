# Raw Data

This folder contains raw data that the user has generated for the purposes of this research project.
Even if the raw data doesn't need to be pre-processed in some manner before being used in analyses located in `/Results/`, this should at least contain quality control metrics, descriptions, and information including:

* experimental design
* purpose of experiment
* brief description of what the data is
* brief description of data formats, if not standard
